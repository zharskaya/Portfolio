            <p>
              Developers work within a rich ecosystem of tools, documentation, and codebases. Yet when using AI coding assistants, they often struggle to get accurate results because the assistant lacks sufficient context. Instead of saving time, they end up explaining, correcting, or even rewriting code manually. This undermines efficiency, slows adoption, and prevents the tool from reaching its full potential.

          <p>
            Design a seamless experience that brings the right context into the coding assistant, so developers can focus on building instead of fixing.
